### Final Report Summary

Based on a detailed analysis of 10 years of traffic collision data, we have uncovered several key insights into the trends, hotspots, and contributing factors of road safety in Toronto.

**1. Overall Collision Trends**
* **Annually:** We observed a clear upward trend in collisions leading to a peak in 2019, followed by a dramatic drop in 2020 due to the pandemic.
* **Seasonally:** Collisions are most frequent in late autumn, correlating with the onset of poor weather conditions.
* **Hourly & Weekly:** We identified a strong correlation with commuting patterns, with collisions peaking during the evening rush hour on Fridays.

**2. Geographical Hotspots**
* The **downtown core** is the most significant hotspot for collisions, with a high concentration of incidents at major intersections.
* Analysis by police division revealed that Division D32 experiences the highest number of collisions.

**3. Severity and Involved Parties**
* While most collisions are property damage, approximately **16% involve injuries**.
* Vulnerable road users, such as **pedestrians and cyclists**, are at heightened risk, with their collisions peaking during the evening commute, aligning with a rise in injury collisions.
